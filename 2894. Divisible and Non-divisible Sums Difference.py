'''Divisible and Non-divisible Sums Difference

Example 1:

Input: n = 10, m = 3
Output: 19
Explanation: In the given example:
- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are not divisible by 3 are [1,2,4,5,7,8,10], num1 is the sum of those integers = 37.
- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3 are [3,6,9], num2 is the sum of those integers = 18.
We return 37 - 18 = 19 as the answer.'''

class Solution:
    def differenceOfSums(self, n: int, m: int) -> int:
        a = 0
        b = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i % m == 0:
                b = b + i
            if i % m != 0:
                a = a + i
                
        return a - b
